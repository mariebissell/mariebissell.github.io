I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Ohio State University, where I work with [Cynthia Clopper](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/clopper.1) and [Kathryn Campbell-Kibler](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/campbellkibler.1) on research projects relating to sociophonetics and laboratory phonology, especially with respect to dialectology and sound change in American English varieties. My research concerns both the production and perception sides of how sound changes occur, focusing on phonetic and social factors. 
<br><br>
I previously completed an M.A. in English (Linguistics) at North Carolina State University in 2019, where I worked with [Robin Dodsworth](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/rmdodswo/), [Jeff Mielke](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/jimielke/), and [Walt Wolfram](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/wolfram/). I completed a B.A. in Linguistics and a B.A. in Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis in 2017, where I worked with [John Baugh](https://psych.wustl.edu/people/john-baugh).

<strong>Current projects</strong><br>
<i>Pre-voiceless diphthong raising in Greater New Orleans, Louisiana</i>: We are investigating the phonetic origin, diachronic implementation, and phonologization of pre-voiceless /aj/ and /aw/ raising. This project is an ongoing collaboration with [Katie Carmichael](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty/katie-carmichael.html) at Virginia Tech, [Kelly Berkson](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/about/faculty/berkson-kelly.html) at Indiana, and [Irina Shport](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/english/faculty/faculty/ishport.php) at LSU.

<i>Dialect effects on perceptual adaptation and generalization</i>: My second qualifying paper examines how dialect experience with particular types of vowel shifts in regional varieties of American English affects perceptual adaptation to and generalization of a novel vowel shift. Preliminary results suggest that certain listeners experience inhibition when the structural features of their native dialects do not align with the structural features of the novel accent.
