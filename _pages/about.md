I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Ohio State University, where I work with [Cynthia Clopper](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/clopper.1) and [Kathryn Campbell-Kibler](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/campbellkibler.1) on research projects relating to laboratory phonology and language variation and change. I combine methodologies from phonetics, phonology, and sociolinguistics to explore the origins and implementations of allophonic patterns in American English regional dialects. I am interested in how changes in both perceptiona and production can inform theories of sound change, and especially theories of phonologization, more generally.
<br><br>
I have worked on the origins of pre-voiceless diphthong raising ("American raising") in several US cities, including New Orleans and Columbus (OH), and of /aw/ retraction in Raleigh, a city where the Southern Vowel Shift is receding. My research program focuses on how phonetic and social factors in tandem come to affect the uptake and diachronic development of different allophonic patterns, especially those involving American English diphthongs.
<br><br>
I previously completed an M.A. in English (Linguistics) at North Carolina State University in 2019, where I worked with [Robin Dodsworth](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/rmdodswo/), [Jeff Mielke](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/jimielke/), and [Walt Wolfram](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/wolfram/). I completed a B.A. in Linguistics and a B.A. in Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis in 2017, where I worked with [John Baugh](https://psych.wustl.edu/people/john-baugh).

<strong>Current projects</strong><br>
<i>Pre-voiceless diphthong raising in several U.S. cities</i>: We are investigating the phonetic origin, diachronic implementation, and phonologization of pre-voiceless /aj/ and /aw/ raising among American English speakers in Indiana, Ohio, and Louisiana. This project is an ongoing collaboration with [Katie Carmichael](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty/katie-carmichael.html) at Virginia Tech, [Kelly Berkson](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/about/faculty/berkson-kelly.html) at Indiana University, and [Irina Shport](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/english/faculty/faculty/ishport.php) at LSU.
<br><br>
<i>Dialect effects on perceptual adaptation and generalization</i>: My second qualifying paper examines how dialect experience with particular types of vowel shifts in regional varieties of American English affects perceptual adaptation to and generalization of a novel vowel shift. This manuscript is in preparation.
