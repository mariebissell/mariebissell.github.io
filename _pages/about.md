I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Ohio State, where I am currently advised by Cynthia Clopper and Kathryn Campbell-Kibler. My current research for my first qualifying paper examines how pre-voiceless diphthongal raising interacts with voicing correlates in different varieties of American English. 

I completed an M.A. in English (Linguistics) at North Carolina State University in May 2019, where I was advised by Jeff Mielke and Robin Dodsworth.

I completed a B.A. in Linguistics and a B.A. in Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis in May 2017, where I was advised by John Baugh.

Current research
======
I am primarily interested in sociophonetics and laboratory phonology, especially with respect to processes of language variation and change. 

I am currently collaborating with Katie Carmichael (Virginia Tech) on a research project examining the phonetic dynamics of this kind of raising among speakers in Chalmette, Louisiana. We use generalized additive models (GAMs) to analyze the phonetic characteristics of raised variants in this dialect.

I am also currently collaborating with Jeff Mielke (North Carolina State University) and Bridget Smith on an NSF-funded project entitled “Phonological implications of covert articulatory variation” (BCS-1451475). We examine covert variation in /l/ productions using ultrasound imaging, including intrusive [l], /l/-vocalization, and liquid-adjacent vowel quality.

I am also currently collaborating with Walt Wolfram (North Carolina State University) on a research project examining ethnolinguistic patterning of back vowel variation in a tri-ethnic contact scenario in Robeson County, North Carolina. We examine acoustic phonetic vocalic changes across three ethnic populations over time to investigate how back vowel fronting interacts with social stratification and ethnolinguistic differentiation.

I am also currently collaborating with Cynthia Clopper (Ohio State University) and Abby Walker (Virginia Tech) on a research project examining the effects of regional vocalic variation on perceptual encoding processes. 

In my spare time
======
I enjoy crocheting, hiking, and birds.
