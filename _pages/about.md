I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics & TESOL at the University of Texas at Arlington. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Linguistics at Ohio State University in 2024, where I was advised by [Cynthia Clopper](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/clopper.1) and [Kathryn Campbell-Kibler](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/campbellkibler.1). 
<br><br>
I am primarily interested in how phonetic, phonological, and social factors affect the production and perception of dialect-specific allophonic systems. In the realm of production, I work on how each of these types of factors contributes to the actuation and propagation of changes in these allophonic systems. In the realm of perception, I work on how listeners' exposure to dialect-specific allophonic systems affects their phonological and lexical processing. Taken together, these lines of research aim to probe how changes in dialect-specific allophonic systems manifest and what they reveal about cognitive representations of language variation.
<br><br>
I have worked on the origins of pre-voiceless diphthong raising ("American raising") in several U.S. cities using production data, including New Orleans (LA) and Columbus (OH), and of /aw/ retraction in Raleigh (NC), a city where the Southern Vowel Shift is receding. 
<br><br>
I previously completed an M.A. in English (Linguistics) at North Carolina State University in 2019, where I worked with [Robin Dodsworth](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/rmdodswo/), [Jeff Mielke](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/jimielke/), and [Walt Wolfram](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/wolfram/). I completed a B.A. in Linguistics and a B.A. in Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis in 2017, where I worked with [John Baugh](https://psych.wustl.edu/people/john-baugh).

<strong>Current projects</strong><br>
<i>Pre-voiceless diphthong raising in several U.S. cities</i>: We are investigating the phonetic origin, diachronic implementation, and phonologization of pre-voiceless /aj/ and /aw/ raising among American English speakers in Indiana, Ohio, and Louisiana. This project is an ongoing collaboration with [Katie Carmichael](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty/katie-carmichael.html) at Virginia Tech, [Kelly Berkson](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/about/faculty/berkson-kelly.html) at Indiana University, and [Irina Shport](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/english/faculty/faculty/ishport.php) at LSU.
<br><br>
<i>Dialect effects on perceptual adaptation and generalization</i>: My second qualifying paper examines how dialect experience with particular types of vowel shifts in regional varieties of American English affects perceptual adaptation to and generalization of a novel vowel shift. This manuscript is in preparation.
