I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Ohio State University, where I work with [Cynthia Clopper](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/clopper.1) and [Kathryn Campbell-Kibler](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/campbellkibler.1) on research projects relating to sociophonetics and laboratory phonology, especially with respect to dialectology and sound change in American English varieties. My research concerns both the production and perception sides of how sound changes occur, focusing on phonetic and social factors. My current projects include investigations of /aw/ raising in Columbus, Ohio and in Greater New Orleans, Louisiana (with [Katie Carmichael](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty/katie-carmichael.html) at Virginia Tech), in addition to work on how linguistic experience impacts speech perception.

I previously completed an M.A. in English (Linguistics) at North Carolina State University in 2019, where I worked with [Robin Dodsworth](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/rmdodswo/), [Jeff Mielke](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/jimielke/), and [Walt Wolfram](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/wolfram/). I completed a B.A. in Linguistics and a B.A. in Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis in 2017, where I worked with [John Baugh](https://psych.wustl.edu/people/john-baugh).
