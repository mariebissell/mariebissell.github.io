I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at Ohio State University, where I work with [Cynthia Clopper](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/clopper.1) and [Kathryn Campbell-Kibler](https://linguistics.osu.edu/people/campbellkibler.1) on research projects relating to sociophonetics and laboratory phonology, especially with respect to dialectology and sound change in American English varieties. My research concerns both the production and perception sides of how sound changes occur, focusing on phonetic and social factors. One of my current projects is a multi-site investigation of of /aw/ raising in Columbus, Ohio and Louisiana (with [Katie Carmichael](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty/katie-carmichael.html) at Virginia Tech, [Kelly Berkson](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/about/faculty/berkson-kelly.html) at Indiana University, and [Irina Shport](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/english/faculty/faculty/ishport.php) at Louisiana State University). I am also working on an ongoing project about how dialect experience impacts perceptual adaptation to and generalization of novel dialects.

I previously completed an M.A. in English (Linguistics) at North Carolina State University in 2019, where I worked with [Robin Dodsworth](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/rmdodswo/), [Jeff Mielke](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/jimielke/), and [Walt Wolfram](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/wolfram/). I completed a B.A. in Linguistics and a B.A. in Anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis in 2017, where I worked with [John Baugh](https://psych.wustl.edu/people/john-baugh).
